## Bass Pickup Clip (4/2023)

### Problem:
My director purchased a pickup for the school bass that I was tasked with assembling, but it was missing the piece that secures the audio-output jack to the bass itself.

### Solution:
I made a new audio jack holder/clip, and corrected a major design flaw.

**Details:**
This was the first project I made for use in my school, and also one that sees use every single day in my Jazz Band class. 

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- **Challenge: The original clip design required removing the entire string from the instrument to thread the attachment on, but that was a bit risky with the used strings on my school's bass** 
    - Solution: Create a slit in the clip's design that allows the clip to be slid on without taking off the entire string. 
- **Challenge: The clip needed to be able to slide over ridges on the audio jack's exterior but still needed to be held securely once in place**
    - Solution: Make the clip adaptively clamp down on the audio jack when the string is tensioned, and make the original design a bit oversized so the pickup can slide through initially.
- **Challenge: Because I made the design of the clip clamp-like, the slit for the string was no longer lining up once the two sides were squeezed together** 
    - Solution: Offset the slits from each other just the slightest amount so the slits can fit on the string both with and without tension on the clip.

#### Conclusions:
This thing works great. It's been through three school years and several bass players, and it's still just as secure as it was on day one. My band director loves showing it off as a little bit of engineering that I've contributed to his program.
