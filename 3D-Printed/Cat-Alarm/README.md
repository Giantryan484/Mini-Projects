## Cat Alarm (8/2022)

### Problem:
My cat is a nosy fellow. Like literally. He uses his nose to open my door all the time. He can open doors through a series of acrobatics, making almost every room available to him. Sometimes, I'll be working on a delicate project or I'll simply be out of town and he'll sneak in while I'm gone and ruin everything.

### Solution:
Create an alarm system that will scare away my nosy cat whenever I don't want him in my room.

**Details:**
This was the first mechanical system I designed with my 3D printer; before then, everything had been static parts. It was also my first time combining 3D prints with other materials, because I used wooden skewers as rails for the marbles to slide along.

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- **Challenge: I want to make a loud noise to scare him, but not deafen him**
    - Solution: Have the mechanism drop marbles onto the carpeted floor from a significant height.
- **Challenge: I don't want the mechanism to go off too early or on accident** 
    - Solution: Perfectly size the arm that attaches to the door so the marbles won't fall until the door is significantly cracked open.
- **Challenge: I don't want to hit my cat in the head** 
    - Solution: Put the alarm on the side opposite of where his head will be, as close to the wall as posisble while still letting the mechanism work.

#### Conclusions:
This is perhaps the silliest of my inventions. It only took about a month before he stopped trying to get into my room at all, so I'd call this a success.

Congratulations on reading this deep into my application! I've put lots of work into this documentation so I truly appreciate it if you've come this far. If you like what I do in these mini projects, consider checking out the other, larger projects pinned on my github account. In the meanwhile, here's some more pictures of my cat:
