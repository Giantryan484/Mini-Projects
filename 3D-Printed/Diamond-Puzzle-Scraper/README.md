## Diamond Puzzle Scraper (12/2022)

### Problem:
My friend and I like to do diamond puzzles together to relax, which involves lining up tiny plastic diamonds on a small alignment device so you can use a specialized tool to grab rows of diamonds at a time. The problem is, removing the diamonds from this alignment device is exceedingly difficult because of small electric charges that make the plastic bits stick together.

### Solution:
Create a specialized raking tool that lets me quickly clear all the diamonds from the alignment boards.

**Details:**
I tried to make this design completely flat because I only had about one hour to design and print it (I had the idea one day when my friend was at my place, and I was trying to get it made before they had to leave). I was sucessful and, as a result, it was perhaps the quickest engineering project I've done up until this day.

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- **Challenge: The alignment board has ridges on it that are high enough for diamonds to slip under something scraping the top** 
    - Solution: Add small holes in the scraper design that allow the scraper to reach inside the areas betweeen the ridges
- **Challenge: The bottom of the alignment board is tapered**
    - Solution: Make the scraper slightly smaller so that it can be easily rotated to reach the diamonds in the tapered section.
- **Challenge: The tool is fairly small and hard to grip onto** 
    - Solution: Add a make-shift grip made of masking tape. Adding a grip to the model itself would make printing it without supports rather difficult and would've upped my printing time by an order of magnitude, so I went with a jerry-rigged solution.

#### Conclusions:
This thing works great. I made some copies of this tool for my friends at school. If I were desperate enough I probably could've sold this as a product back when diamond puzzles were a frenzy on TikTok.
