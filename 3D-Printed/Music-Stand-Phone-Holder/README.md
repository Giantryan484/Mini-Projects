## Music Stand Phone Holder (4/2024)

### Problem:
Our drama director decided to schedule rehearsal week for the musical the same week as the SAT. I had hours upon hours of rehearsal in place of SAT study time, but I had problems and flashcards I needed to study using Anki regardless. The problem is, I didn't have a good way to keep my phone upright, charged, and accessible at the same time, all while sitting on my music stand.

### Solution:
Create a stand that will allow my phone to remain charged with the screen on for hours at a time while in the upright position.

**Details:**
This was a bit of a silly project; I know it probably would have been easier to just buy a L-shaped cord for my phone online, but I wanted an excuse to use my 3D printer again.

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- **Challenge: My phone's cord should be able to fit into the stand without having to feed it through the tiny holes** 
    - Solution: Add a diagonal slit into the stand that is large enough for the cord to fit through, so now the phone and charger can be slid on and off the stand without complication.
- **Challenge: My charging-bank is button activated**
    - Solution: Arrange the system so that the battery bank's button is accessible.
- **Challenge: My stand has limited space, and I still need a place to store things like my bass rosin** 
    - Solution: Make the interior of the stand hollow to function as extra storage space.

#### Conclusions:
I completely fumbled the 3D printing side of this one, and the result was a ton of duct tape. I used big layer heights cause I didn't want the print to take 3 days, but I forgot to add extra material to account for that. So, layer adhesion was nonexistent and, upon dropping it, it snapped in two. But, I needed to use it the very next day, so I taped it up as a temporary solution... but never got around to making a non-temporary solution.
