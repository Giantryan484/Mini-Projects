## Bass Music Stand (10/2024)

### Problem:
When playing bass in my school's football pep band, I need to read music. The problem is, when it's pitch black outside and I've got dozens of sweaty high schoolers blocking my view, I can't read my music, much less see the drum major.

### Solution:
I made a little clip-on music stand with a built-in light so I can read my music in any condition. I can also stand up to see the drum major's conducting now, and I can actually watch the football game (we won 62-21; it was quite fun).

**Details:**
I made this about 15 minutes before our homecoming football game (it was quite a busy week). Don't judge the materials or looks too harshly; I was working under some wild constraints.

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- **Challenge: I need it to be secure on my bass, but I don't want to permanently bind it there** 
    - Solution: Secure it with an elastic hair tie and very light sticky foam. 
- **Challenge: I don't want the metal on the clip to damage the finish on my bass**
    - Solution: Add a foam spacer and cover everything in duct tape so the metal won't scratch it.
- **Challenge: I need to be able to see the music, even when someone is covering the stadium lights** 
    - Solution: Add a cute little coin-battery circuit to light up the music. I also made it able to turn on/off by insulating the ends of the LED, so I can pull it slightly outwards to turn it off whenever.

#### Conclusions:
This was a pretty satisfying project because it created gratification just minutes after I made it. It served as a conversation starter, especially with the coin-battery circuit on there. My directors thought it was clever.
