## Dog Bag Dispenser (11/2023)

### Problem:
We bought these rolls of bags, and each time we took the dog on a walk we brought one with us. The problem was, it was quite difficult to dispense a bag one-handed from the roll when we were wrangling a crazy dog with the other hand.

### Solution:
I designed a wall-mount for the bags so that I could dispense them one-handed.

#### Conclusions:
This model and concept were very simple, but this was a case where the problem itself wasn't very hard on its own. Especially as my dog aged, he got less and less energetic, and grabbing a bag for the walk became trivially easy.
