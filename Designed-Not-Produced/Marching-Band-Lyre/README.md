## Marching Band Lyre (8/2023)

### Problem:
I play the largest bass drum in our marching band, and while I'm doing parades and playing at the football stands, it's helpful to have sheet music to reference. The problem is, I don't have any way to hold sheet music securely while wearing the drum.

### Solution:
I designed a custom lyre that could mount itself to the existing brackets on the drum.

#### Conclusions:
Again, as is the theme with these design-only projects, I simply found an easier solution: memorize the music. There are also some pre-made lyres for about $10, so making my own wouldn't have saved me much anyway.
