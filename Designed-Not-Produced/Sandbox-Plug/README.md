## Sandbox Plug (2/2024)

### Problem:
There's this bin at my church that we often fill with sand to make a sensory experience for the children who need it. The problem is, we lost the plug years ago, and currently the only thing keeping sand in is a ton of tape.

### Solution:
Build a new plug that fits the hole perfectly. Add O-rings for a watertight seal if needed.

#### Conclusions:
Yet again, we ended up just finding an easier solution. We bought a rubber test-tube plug for less than $1 that worked just fine.
