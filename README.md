# Mini-Projects

Welcome to my Mini-Project GitHub Repository. This is where I keep record of my solutions to various household inconveniences, hopefully giving insight into my engineering and design process. Detailed information about the design, materials, build process, and challenges encountered can be found in each project's respective folder (linked below).

## My Mini-Project Build Process
### 1. Be inconvenienced
I build most of my projects because a previous solution was terribly inconvenient. These sorts of problems are the easiest to come across, as they don't take any research or surveying, instead they simply slap you in the face.
### 2. Designing
For most projects, I'll make a brief sketch/plan of what I think the final project will look like/do before I go into the CAD software. For some projects, this is simply listing features that are required for it to work properly. For others, this is multiple days of detailed measurement and drawing.
### 3. Prototyping
Whenever possible, especially when dealing with precise fits, I print partial prototypes of my parts so that I can ensure I've designed them properly. This keeps me from wasting material and time on prints that aren't acceptable.
### 4. Make it!
This is the fun part, and perhaps the most satisfying. But, at the same time, it can be the most disappointing. I'll slice my model and get it printing on my $99 Ender 3, and in just a few hours (or days) I'll have a working product...except when I don't. Often times layers will shift, the printer head will wildy change in temperature (I guess that's what I get for $99), or my full design will simply not work in some way that I didn't account for in my prototypes. But, it only takes a few more hours of effort for me to get everything working as it should, and then, finally, I'll have a solution to whatever minor inconvenience I decided to address.
